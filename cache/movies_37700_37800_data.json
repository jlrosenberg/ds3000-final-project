Entering a local club, she meets a troubled drug addict.","1":"In the Mumbai, India, tenement community of Pavanpul, young female courtesans sing, dance and perform sexual favors for male clientele. Directors James Ivory and Ismail Merchant blend documentary footage and dramatic reenactments in their exploration of this seamy underworld, the flip side of the Bollywood film industry, where aspiring actors and dancers -- some even sold into prostitution by their own families -- end up, with their innocence lost and their hopes for movie stardom shattered.","2":"An impressionistic experimental drama. A woman walks a fine line between sanity and madness in a world of constant twilight. She works at a filling station and lives a life of emotional isolation. No one seems to pay attention to her, and she lives in a run-down flat that looks as if it's decaying before our eyes. As the woman wrestles with the demons that are taking hold within her mind, she frequently confronts herself in the mirror, often while naked.","3":"Emma, a young author, goes to see Erik, the publishing editor whom she's sent her debut novel. Their meeting leads to a love affair. The middle-aged Erik leaves his wife. What Erik doesn't know is that Emma recently began a relationship with the dramatist Stefan, whose play is also being published by Erik's company. One day Stefan overdoses and is brought to the emergency ward where Erik's wife Ann works as a doctor. These incident is the start of the story about how four people's lives are crossed during ten years, until the four of them finally end up in the same loneliness they started.","4":"This is a ballad about love, hate, and a search for a way out of loneliness. It is a dramatic story about the strange potter, Martin Leaps, nicknamed Dragon, who is suspected by the villagers as the cause of natural disasters. He lost his wife, his home, and his freedom due to false accusations. After years he returns to his native village. Putting his own life to risk, he saves a herd of sheep from a forest fire in the hills. But not even this heroic deed helps him to win back the friendship of the locals.","5":"Jim is a shy, withdrawn loner, pervert, and virgin. Lana is a friendly and outgoing born again Christian who has renounced her promiscuous drug filled past. They have never met until they step into an elevator together one day. The elevator gets stuck between floors, and they start to get to know each other...","6":"A sensitive portrait of Sabine Bonnaire, the autistic sister of the french actress Sandrine Bonnaire.","7":"F\u00e9lix, operator of dodgem cars in a fairground, becomes obsessed by one of his customers, a mysterious young woman named Lola. F\u00e9lix soon discovers that Lola is running away from her former boyfriend, a singer who continues to taunt her. Lola asks F\u00e9lix to prove his love for her by murdering a man he does not know...","8":"Three friends, Hilda, Matilda and Gaspar, meet in a rundown downtown apartment during a weekend to chat, drink and experience pleasure.","9":"London has always been a source of influence, inspiration and curiosity - Finisterre tries to identify the dreams that London holds for so many. Presented and scored by Saint Etienne, the film enraptures with a journey through the ultimate city of possibilities - from John Nash and Berthold Lubetkin to Hendon FC and Hampstead Heath via the New Piccadilly cafe. A genuinely moving meditation on the capital in all its tawdry glory, with extra features and deluxe booklet","10":"1931: in Ireland, a film maker hears of an aged ship's carpenter who knows the fate of the Hollandia, a Norse ship that set sail in 1905 and vanished. The old salt has canisters of film to prove his tale. We see the footage as he narrates. They sail south in June, 1905, with scores of Siberian huskies aboard, meeting no living soul, the crew ignorant of the trip's purpose, until they reach Antarctica. A mysterious Italian paces the deck; a polar bear appears, and the Italian, possessed, hunts it down. That night, the boatswain explains to the crew how an Arctic bear could be at the South Pole and why the Hollandia has come. Visitors arrive, and the Gothic tale plays out.","11":"Francis Bacon revolutionised figurative painting in the 20th century. The English painter unmasked his subjects in a provocative and ruthless manner. Deformed bodies, grimacing faces and the materiality of colour make us aware of brutality and sexuality, existential abysses and the fears of existence. Author Melvyn Bragg accompanies the painter throughout his day. This begins in his London atelier, leads us on to his favourite pub and ends up in gambling club in Soho.","12":"Set in a toy store specialized in antique toys, a boy works in the toy store and is obsessed with tin toys. There's one particular tin toy he loves more than the rest. In walks a girl wearing shades, and starts telling her own story, a weird and fascinating experience she had with a toy.","13":"The seven short films making up GENIUS PARTY couldn\u2019t be more diverse, linked only by a high standard of quality and inspiration. Atsuko Fukushima\u2019s intro piece is a fantastic abstraction to soak up with the eyes. Masaaki Yuasa, of MIND GAME and CAT SOUP fame, brings his distinctive and deceptively simple graphic style and dream-state logic to the table with \u201cHappy Machine,\u201d his spin on a child\u2019s earliest year. Shinji Kimura\u2019s spookier \u201cDeathtic 4,\u201d meanwhile, seems to tap into the creepier corners of a child\u2019s imagination and open up a toybox full of dark delights. Hideki Futamura\u2019s \u201cLimit Cycle\u201d conjures up a vision of virtual reality, while Yuji Fukuyama\u2019s \"Doorbell\" and \"Baby Blue\" by Shinichiro Watanabe use understated realism for very surreal purposes. And Shoji Kawamori, with \u201cShanghai Dragon,\u201d takes the tropes and conventions of traditional anime out for very fun joyride.","14":"A mysterious power failure in a small mountain town coincides with the disappearance of one of its most eccentric young residents. Mystery piles upon mystery as his family and friends search for him, fail, and ultimately try to forget about him, an undertaking that results in many unexpected, and in some cases bizarre, effects on the town's already peculiar community.","15":"Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly looks at her own life and wonders how she became miles apart from the people she is closest to.","16":"Gypo is the story of a working class family in Margate, Kent, a town where immigrants have become the focus of most of the public's discontent.  The film tells the story of the a couple of weeks in this family's life, beginning when a young Czech girl, Tash, comes to visit.  The film is made in the Dogme95 tradition, so no costumes, no lighting, no props or sets, which gives the film a gritty texture appropriate to the story.","17":"A withering craftsman caters to the requests of iron ore. He breathes life into them as he listens to their wishes. His most prominent creation, a traveling box, wanders the landscape, following railroad tracks, collecting the memories of people. In this harsh world, life is dwindling and the craftsman designs machines to assist life, even that of a tree. The craftsman is more than a creator as he helps maintain the machines. As his life dwindles, so do the lives of these machines.","18":"The wealthy president of a company has built up an unpayable debt to a local crime lord, and to escape punishment he sells his famous dancer wife to the lecherous old man figuring a 90 year old can\u2019t do too much bad with her. Perhaps not, but others can while he watches. She\u2019s put on stage in an underground BDSM sex show and begins a spiraling decent from strongly independent woman to submissive sex slave","19":"Harry Munter, a sensitive, kind, appealing man in his twenties, lives with his parents. He's an inventor, a bit of a mystic, maybe a genius, and a good son and grandson. He's offered work in the U.S. But a friend has cancer and the world is changing in ways that provoke profound sadness. Written by Eileen Berdon","20":"Documentary about the last four seasons on the farm run by the director's parents. The film starts on 1 January 1992, at 6 am and ends in a misty landscape at the end of that year. Het is een schone dag geweest (It's been a beautiful day) shows the end of a farm venture for which no successor has been found, but also the disappearance of a traditional way of life. Modern agriculture is ruled by new regulations, largely made in Brussels. Lonely work on a noisy machine replaces hard but communal work on the land. In a disciplined style, the film shows the disappearance of a traditional lifestyle in part of Holland. Het is een schone dag geweest was \u00efn 2007 admitted to the \"Canon van de Nederlandse Film\", a list of the most important Dutch films. (filmcommission.nl)","21":"A year on an Alpine farm: an older couple have two children, Belli, who wanted to be a teacher, and the younger Franzi, deaf, and although he works like a man, child-like. Belli teaches him. In his work, he can become frustrated, so when he throws an expensive mower over a cliff in a fit of pique, his father banishes him to the outskirts of the farm, where he uses pubescent energy to break rocks and build walls and cairns. (It's the tradition of the father's family, called \"The Irascibles\" by neighbors, to spend puberty doing this.) Belli visits him and they begin sleeping together. By winter, the boy is back in the house and Belli is pregnant. Soon her parents must know.","22":"Set in the beginning of the 20th century Japan, the film follows the bright and eccentric Kenji from his late student years through his adulthood. Kenji suffers the tragedy of being an artist who's art isn't recognized during his lifetime. Based on the life of the author Kenji Miyazawa, the film depicts his brief but intense existence.","23":"Luxembourg's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2003","24":"An ethnographic treasure that documents with visual bravado the harsh conditions of life in the isolated mountain village of Ushkul.","25":"Ayesha is a widow with a secret past, living with her beloved son Saleem in a small town in Pakistan close to the Indian border. When the fires of Islamic nationalism invade their tranquil lives, Saleem and a few of the town's other young men are soon gripped by a religious fervour, and they attempt to bring radical Islamic law to their friends and neighbours. After a group of Sikh pilgrims arrive in town, tensions reach boiling point as Ayesha's haunted past comes rushing back.","26":"Akira had to transfer schools upon graduation because of her father's job.
