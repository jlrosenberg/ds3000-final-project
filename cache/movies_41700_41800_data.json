Clara is beaten, raped, starved, and locked up like an animal, filthy and naked. She is forced to write in the scrapbook, adding her agony to the pages. She soon realizes that her only hope for survival is to manipulate Leonard through her writings in his cherished scrapbook.","2":"MIDNIGHT SON is the story of Jacob, a young man confined to a life of isolation, due to a rare skin disorder that prevents him from being exposed to sunlight. His world opens up when he meets Mary, a local bartender, and falls in love. Tragically, Jacob\u2019s actions become increasingly bizarre as he struggles to cope with the effects of his worsening condition. Forced by the disease to drink human blood for sustenance, he must control his increasingly violent tendencies as local law enforcement narrow their focus on him as a suspect in a series of grisly murders.","3":"A mysterious new girl arrives in posh suburban neighborhood and quickly sets out to terrorize the town.

Ryan is a force to be reckoned with, and he's not letting up any time soon. The victim here isn't a young girl. This one doesn't just go quietly, either. She fights back. She knows she's in trouble, but she mistakenly thinks she can get away. In other movies, she would escape and somber music would play as the credits creep up the screen. The audience would leave the theatre satisfied that the bad guy got what he deserved. They would go home feeling safe. Ryan doesn't let anyone have such notions. He shows things as they really are. This is what a killer would film. This is how it would look, and if you didn't know any better, you'd swear it was real. (And you still can't be totally sure it's not.)","7":"When lead singer Jimmy Taranto dumps his girlfriend Candy then his rock band Gutter Filth, Candy decides to take his place in the band.

And so we realize there's more to 'Swingers' than just sex. Swingers: could your relationship stand the test?","9":"A psychological thriller.

In a nation that appears uncertain how to feel about its own history with exploitation film and generally reluctant to embrace genre film - though there are obvious exceptions - Karacadag has jumped headlong into the horror pool.
