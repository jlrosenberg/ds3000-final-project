animation.","1":"\"Stink!\" opens with a foul smell and a pair of kids pajamas. And a single father trying to find out what that smell could possibly be. But instead of getting a straight answer, director Jon Whelan stumbles on an even bigger issue in America, which is that some products on our store shelves are not safe -- by design. Entertaining, enlightening, and at times almost absurd, \"Stink!\" takes you on a madcap journey from the retailer to the laboratory, through corporate boardrooms, down back alleys, and into the halls of Congress. Follow Whelan as he clashes with political and corporate operatives all trying to protect the darkest secrets of the chemical industry. You won't like what you smell.","2":"A documentary about actor\/director Dennis Hopper, showing him at his home and studio putting together his film \"The Last Movie.\"","3":"Portrait of the popular Dutch singer Andr\u00e9 Hazes.","4":"An old Russian grandmother or \"babushka\", who took part in the Battle of Stalingrad, sacrificed everything for her children and even sold her house to get money for her grandchildren, is shuttled among those very grandchildren--products of the \"new\" Russia--none of whom want her to stay with them since she's too much of a \"burden\" for them.","5":"Many women are confronted with a young, slim and tight beauty ideal and worry a great deal if they can't live up to that image. Sunny Bergman asks in whose interest it is for her and other women to have these concerns, what's at stake, what's to gain and what's to lose. In this film, Bergman looks for the cause, the effects, and possible solutions for the Western preoccupation with our image.","6":"The film is a study of the differences and similarities between human and animal behaviour. The first part of the movie focuses on the behaviour of various animal species. The second half is about humans. In the original Dutch version writer Anton Koolhaas, who also wrote the script, provided the voice-over.","7":"Two very different love stories cross each other in warm and magical way. A humanistic and yet mysterious film about love and death near the German\/Danish border.","8":"Bloody Cartoons is a documentary about how and why 12 drawings in a Danish provincial paper could whirl a small country into a confrontation with Muslims all over the world. He asks whether respect for Islam combined with the heated response to the cartoons is now leading us towards self-censorship. How tolerant should we be, he wonders, of the intolerant. And what limits should there be, if any, to freedom of speech in a democracy.","9":"A lawyer, defending a Mafia boss, falls for a beautiful woman with a sad story to tell. She says she's being abused by her brutal husband and she needs his help.","10":"This historic drama is set in an Ossetian village in the 17th century. The film\u2019s main hero is Chermen.

Guided by mercenary motives, Dacco strikes a deal with Prince Tsarai. Together, they rob people and then divide the loot between themselves.

At first, he thinks that no one in the Aldar village would believe him, the bastard, and that the plot would remain unexposed. But the friends accept the challenge.","11":"No overview found.","12":"Four people with different values and standards meet in the urban chaos of Copacabana.

Quit\u00e9ria is naive, a gull for thieves. Cida has a husband and also a lover. While each woman gets what she wishes for (more or less), it doesn't always make things better.","14":"18-year old Christian has just graduated from high school. At his summer job he is seduced by the 36-year old single mother Sanne.
