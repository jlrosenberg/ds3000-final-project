While offering pro bono services, a lawyer Junyoung meets Hyun-woo, and they begin their journey to prove his innocence.","1":"Internationally known graffiti artist, Banksy, left his mark on San Francisco in April 2010. Little did he know that this act of vandalism would spark a chain of events that includes one of his rats being removed from a wall, Museums ignorantly turning down a free Banksy street work, and a NY gallerist who has made it his business model to remove Banksy street works from all over the globe doing whatever it takes to get the rat in his possession.","2":"A German soldier tries to determine if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy to infiltrate the home of Kaiser Wilhelm in Holland during the onset of World War II, but falls for a young Jewish Dutch woman during his investigation.","3":"Interviews about the film \"Meanwhile\" with director Hal Hartley, actor DJ Mendel, and editor Kyle Gilman.","4":"A rocky sea voyage as reenacted by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s.","5":"A cop from the future goes back in time to Los Angeles and teams up with his grandfather to capture a master criminal.","6":"A weary traveler stops at an inn along the way to get a good night's sleep, but his rest is interrupted by odd happenings when he gets to his room--beds vanishing and re-appearing, candles exploding, pants flying through the air and his shoes walking away by themselves.","7":"A woman arrives home after the ball. Her servant helps her undress and bathe.","8":"Divers go to work on a wrecked ship (the battleship Maine that was blown up in Havana harbour during the Spanish-American War), surrounded by curiously disproportionate fish.","9":"A delightfully dark, Frankenstein-themed horror comedy about a re-animated corpse, made from the stitched together body parts of three murdered young women, that decides to go on a bloody quest to find their killer and avenge their deaths!","10":null,"11":null,"12":"Based on the first book of the Bible, Genesis is a sweeping and poetic look at the beginning of man's relationship with God. While Jochebed (Venus Monique) hides in a shelter to protect her son from being murdered, she tells him the story of her people over the course of a dangerous night. This film explores the idea that mankind will one day return to the place where we started, but that the journey will be filled with hardship, beauty, and a desperate need to trust the Creator.","13":"With the cameraman atop a moving train car the viewer is given a one minute glimpse of a French urban area.","14":"Miguel is appointed parish priest of a socialist town coinciding with the uprising of 1936. In his struggle to defend the reprisals, the young priest will face the ecclesiastical and military hierarchy, putting his own life at stake.","15":"During a pro lockout, Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt is injured and must choose whether to defend his team against a dangerous new enemy, or be there for his wife as she prepares to give birth to his daughter.","16":"When Tubby the Tuba sets out to find a melody all of his own, his journey results in this enchanting and exciting musical tale. Tubby joins the circus and striving to be part of an orchestra, he travels to the Singing City where along the way he encounters many wonderful characters.","17":"A young man is forced to spend a few days with his father in law...","18":"The story is freely inspired by the life and work of Jan Saudek, who is probably the most well-known Czech photographer internationally and has indisputably been involved in the development of international photography. He has exhibited and sold his work in the largest galleries and art houses, he has earned international recognition and awards, he enjoys great popularity and interest - he is a true phenomenon.","19":"The story of the miraculous evacuation of Allied soldiers from Belgium, Britain, Canada and France, who were cut off and surrounded by the German army from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk between May 26th and June 4th 1940 during World War II.","20":"A man struggles with the tragic memories of his past to make sense of his present, but soon realizes that time isn't the enemy he thinks it is.","21":"Basically, 'Herakles' is an omnium-gatherum of film clips depicting images of machismo. Some of those images are explicitly macho: we see various body-builders flexing their biceps and triceps. Other images seen here are not macho in the literal sense, but are indirectly related to testosterone or cojones on some level: we see military aircraft making bombing raids, and footage of car crashes.","22":"A satire on war and on the stupid things war inspires people to do. Four young men enter an abandoned fortress. Inside, they find military uniforms, which they immediately resolve to use to stage a bizarre war game. Their actions appear all the more senseless in relation to the peaceful everyday reality of the workers in the surrounding countryside.","23":"Early short by Werner Herzog shot while being on location in Greece shooting \"Lebenszeichen\".","24":"The film features several horse trainers and other track workers talking about their roles at the track, always eventually interrupted by an older man who claims to be the true authority, and demands that they be thrown out. One recurring young man, the first to appear, claims that he protects the horses from enthusiastic racing fans. He does not appear to be employed by the track, but seems to provide his services voluntarily. His protection from \"fanatics\" gives the film its title. The film is shot in a documentary style, but the sheer implausibility of the dialogue leaves the exact nature of the film ambiguous.","25":"A documentary by Werner Herzog exploring the different treatment accorded to the disabled in Germany and the USA.","26":"A darkly humorous short documentary about a preschool-age boy ostracised from interactions with his classmates until a girl who has become interested in his pet crow provides the link to social acceptance.","27":"Director Werner Herzog, one of the most highly acclaimed German film makers, joins forces with the great Italian conductor Riccardo Chailly to effect a masterful rendition of this rarely-performed opera involving spectacular scenes of alternating light and dark, pageantry and intimacy. Staged and recorded at Teatro Comunale di Bologna in Bologna, Italy.","28":"Documentary examining Bokassa's rule in the Central African Republic using the testimony of witnesses and visits to key sites.","29":"Jag Mandir is a quiet and often overlooked film in the vast oeuvre of Werner Herzog. Apparently, 20 hours of footage was shot that covered the whole fest and the film hardly presents us a twentieth of that. A native walking into the film in between may well fail to immediately realize that it is his country that is being shown and these are figures from the mythology of various sections of his nation.","30":"Accompanied only by music the film alternates between shots of pilgrims near the tomb of Saint Sergei in Sergiyev Posad, Russia and pilgrims at the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico.","31":"Part of a series of opera shorts by different directors. Herzog combines O Soave Fanciulla (\"Oh you vision of beauty\" from Puccini's La Boheme) with images of harsh life in Africa.  The varied body of work was produced to celebrate six years of Sky Arts' season sponsorship of ENO and both organisations' commitment to widening the appeal of opera. Set to recordings by ENO Orchestra conducted by ENO Music Director Edward Gardner, they feature singers Peter Auty, Geraint Dodd, Mary Plazas and Mark Stone.","32":"In Cave of Forgotten Dreams, celebrated German film director Werner Herzog gained exclusive access to film the 32,000 year old Chauvet caves, which contain the earliest known pictorial creations of humankind. In this follow-up film, Ode to the Dawn of Man, Herzog shows us an insight into the construction of the film\u2019s score with footage and interviews with composer Ernst Reijseger and pianist Harmen Fraanje. Ode to the Dawn of Man draws us into the creation of the truly epic music used in Herzog\u2019s awe-inspiring documentary and the magic created by all those involved including the musicians, composer and Herzog himself. \u2013iTunes","33":"This was the debut for Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. It was also their only cartoon made in the 1940s. It set the template for the series, in which Wile E. Coyote (here given the ersatz Latin name Carnivorous Vulgaris) tries to catch Roadrunner (Accelleratii Incredibus) through many traps, plans and products, although in this first cartoon not all of the products are yet made by the Acme Corporation.","34":"A bulldog adopts a small cat, but he can't let his owner know.","35":"Organ grinder operator Bugs must get rid of his chimp when the ape steals the take from him. The replacement is a gorilla.","36":"Wile E. Coyote, genius, announces to Bugs Bunny that he is going to catch him and eat him, and then employs a variety of gadgets and plans in an attempt to do so.","37":"The bears tempt Goldilocks with carrot soup, the scent of which brings Bugs on the scene. Bugs romances Mama bear and she becomes infatuated with him.","38":"The Tasmanian Devil is on the loose. Bugs offers to help him find his dinner.","39":"\"Children in the Surf, Coney Island\" is a very short documentary with Billy Bitzer behind the camera.","40":"A fine panoramic view of this busy market on a Friday morning. Immense throngs of people are passing along the stands and making their purchases of fish.","41":"We see a man sporting a derby hat and walrus moustache hang a mail sack on one of those poles that stand beside a railway track followed by a second shot of the sack being snatched up by a passing train which also jettisons another sack onto the ground as it passes.","42":"A street level view from the sidewalk, looking along the length of 23rd Street. Following actuality footage of pedestrians and street traffic, the actors, a man in summer attire and a woman in an ankle-length dress, walk toward the camera.","43":"A child borrows his grandmother's magnifying glass to look at a newspaper ad for Bovril, at a watch, and then at a bird. The child shows grandma what he is doing. The child looks next at grandma's eye, then at a kitten.","44":"Possibly the first film to utilize the technique of focus pulling. A man kisses a beautiful and lively woman, then the image blurs and dissolves into a clear image of the man waking up to his nagging wife.","45":"A loan recovery agent takes on a corrupt head of an educational institution to save his girlfriend.\u200b","46":"A witch curses a town's well.","47":"With godly entrapments, Zeus appears on the horizon, engages Hermes as an audience, and tries to throw some thunderbolts. They fizzle. Hephaestus tries to make some repairs but succeeds only in heating the bolts and burning Zeus's hands. Zeus conjures nine muses, but do their incantations help? He dismisses them as well as a visiting Pan, and his fits of pique become counter-productive. Can he get his powers back?","48":"In a corner of the garden we see an ornamental fountain. An old professor comes along, looking for a nice spot where he can teach his pupils. Finding the fountain to his liking he goes after his scholars. A mysterious person who has noticed the old man, by means of a balloon, a handkerchief and a coat, constructs a peculiar figure, doing a lot of tricks at the same time.","49":"In recording this scene the position of our camera was an excellent one, and we present to the public a most perfect picture of the train\u2019s arrival. The engine is decorated with crepe to mark the solemnity of this great historical event. As the train stops at the platform great respect for the dead President is shown by the waiting diplomats and reception committee baring their heads and standing respectfully on one side as the mourners leave the train.","50":"The scenes opens by showing the battleships maneuvering for a position. They finally draw up in line of battle and commence firing on the shore batteries. Immense volume of smoke arise from the fleet and from the distance shore. Shots are seen to fall thickly among the vessels and immense bodies of water are thrown up by the explosion of mines.","51":"A French aristocrat, who has recently arrived in America, has placed a personal advertisement in the newspaper...","52":"At the first news of the disast by cyclone and tidal wave that devastated Galveston on Saturday, September 8th, 1900, we equipped a party of photographers and sent them by special train to the scene of the ruins. Arriving at the scene of desolation shortly after the storm had swept over the city, our party succeeded, at the risk of life and limb, in taking about a thousand feet of motion pictures, although Galveston was under martial law and photographers were shot down at sight by the excited police. The series, taken as a whole, gives a definite idea of the most terrible disaster since the Johnstown flood of 1889.","53":"Two delinquent clerks are seated in a broker's office engaged in a game of cards. The boss suddenly appears walking through the corridor. The cards are thrown down in great haste and when the employer enters the office the clerks are apparently busily engaged in their work.","54":"This picture shows the young cadets going through their daily exercises and drill, and is full of life, and photographically perfect.","55":"Reenactment of a South African battle.","56":"Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep, and that leaves one of them vulnerable to a pack of hillbilly wolves. It's Mighty Mouse to the rescue!","57":"A very stupid and superstitious cat awakens and goes through his usual gyrations of ensuring he will not have an unlucky day, making sure he get out of the right side of the bed and other rituals, and then starts his search for breakfast. He captures Buzzy the Crow, places him between two slices of bread and prepares to eat him. But Buzzy, smarter than the average crow since he is a cartoon parody of Eddie Anderson's \"Rochester\" character, has no intentions of being a cat's sandwich breakfast, knows the cat is superstitious and causes the cat to spill the salt, knowing the cat will have to release him in order to throw some salt over his shoulder. This goes on for a while as Buzzy calls the cat's attention to something that has to be counter-acted by the cat. And, just as the cat seems to have Buzzy about to become a lunch---they carried on all the way through brunch---the cat flees in terror as he sees a fellow cat---black in color---about to cross his path.","58":"Heckle & Jeckle are looking for a place to build a bird house, and they decide to do so on McDougal's Rest Farm, which is reserved for peace and quiet. Dimwit, apparently the guard dog here, tries to stop all the racket.","59":"Baby Parade at Asbury Park, N.J., in 1904.","60":"An evil feudal lord rapes a village girl on her wedding night and proceeds to ruin her and her husband's lives. After she's eventually banished from her village, the girl makes a pact with the devil to gain magical ability and take revenge.","61":"More than a dozen shots, some less than a second, of people wearing roller skates in various settings: a young man in skates sits on a low guardrail next to a city sidewalk reading, a woman with a child shoots by, a constable skates gingerly, a man skates by in suit and vest, another cleans front steps, children skate into a room where papa and siblings sit, someone slips at the base of stairs, a man in a cowboy hat moves fast, two jovial chubby women shake hands, our man in the hat trips over a wheelbarrow, then falls again as he rounds a corner, then down goes the constable. It's a crazy day on the city sidewalks.","62":"U.S. agents send a gymnastic martial artist to secure a missile-base site in the savage country of Parmistan.","63":"","64":"The German legend of a scholar's unholy pact with the Devil would have been very familiar to most moviegoers (at least European ones), so Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' early cinematic treatment likely got away with simply offering a fancifully illustrated late episode without the earlier narrative context (however, spoken narration provides some of the latter in this restored print). Tempted by Mephistopheles with all kinds of dancing and ethereal babes, Faust is at first excited and then terrified by the sight of various demons and monsters. The painted-set designers really went hog wild on this one, depicting the (sometimes sexy) torments of subterranean Hell with in bold terms (even when ballerinas prance in the foreground). (Dennis Harvey, Fandor)","65":"A young woman becomes the eighth wife of the wealthy Bluebeard, whose first seven wives have died under mysterious circumstances.","66":"A re-telling of the classic tale of Faust in all of two minutes by French filmmaker Alice Guy.","67":"A green-skinned demon places a woman and two courtiers into a flaming cauldron.","68":"An Egyptian prince has lost his beloved wife and he has sought a dervish who dwells at the base of the sphinx.","69":"Alone in his room at an inn, a lustful old man is haunted by spirits.","70":"A boy is led into the frame by two nursemaids who give him a big ball to play with. For the remainder of the film heads appear and disappear, stage props blow up and turn into other objects or people, and finally Bob Kick disappears.","71":"A box of valued jewels is placed inside the tomb of Delphi. A thief breaks into the tomb and steals it, but soon the ghost of Delphi appears and puts a curse on him.","72":"Pioneer filmmaker Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s performs his cine-magic act.","73":"As scene as pleasing as incomprehensible. A juggler summons two chairs, which come to the stage jumping and twirling around. Across the back of these chairs the operator places a sheet of glass on which he lays a box about four inches high. He then takes a table cover, with his servant's help, rolls it up and from the centre emerges a lady, beautifully dressed. At the juggler's order she jumps in the box, in which she completely disappears.","74":"At the royal court, a prince is presenting the princess whom he is pledged to marry when a witch suddenly appears. Though driven off, the witch soon returns, summons some of her servants, and carries off the princess. A rescue party is quickly organized, but the unfortunate captive has been taken to a strange, forbidding realm, from where it will be impossible to rescue her without some special help.","75":"Two impish clowns construct a magic lantern. They prop it up at an angle, and use it to project pictures onto a wall. When the picture show ends, they open up the lantern to reveal a group of dancing girls inside - and this is only the first of the indications that this lantern really is magical.","76":"The scene takes place in front of a barrack, where a young soldier is on duty --most laughable and comical","77":"Two bad boys enter the kitchen. One climbs to the kitchen table and takes down the old lamp, the other goes to the flour barrel and scoops out some flour, pouring it into the chimney until it is filled to the top. The lamp is then replaced in the bracket. Grandma enters, scratches a match, removes the lamp chimney, when the flour falls upon her head. It sticks in her hair and fills her eyes, but this is where she turns the tables.","78":"Two travellers are tormented by Satan from inn to inn and eventually experience a buggy ride through the heavens courtesy of the Devil before he takes one of them down to Hell and roasts him on a spit.","79":null,"80":"A demonic magician attempts to perform his act in a strange grotto, but is confronted by a Good Spirit who opposes him.","81":"A pig dressed in fancy clothes flirts with a pretty girl, but she humiliates him and tears off his suit; she then makes him dance for her affections.","82":"A frog hops around a magic fountain.","83":"This early silent era film was released in France circa 1908 by Segundo de Chom\u00f3n. It is partially hand coloured and shows several Japanese characters and eventually a worm change into a butterfly which while flapping it's wings changes colours as it flies.","84":"A pickpocket manages to escape the police through a series of fantastic tricks.","85":"A magician charms a caterpillar and turns it into a butterfly woman.","86":"A magical glowing white motorcar dismembers policemen, drives up buildings, flies through outer space, and can transform into a horse and carriage.","87":"An early hand-tinted adaptation of Ali Baba.","88":"A magical woman and her magical eggs.","89":"Three young children set up a table, and on the table is placed a miniature stage.

She takes him to a cavern, where after a series of encounters with goblins and other elusive creatures, he is presented with a choice of beautiful women of various races. Finally the witch makes his wife appear.","94":"While caring for his sick daughter, a doctor is called away to the sickbed of a neighbor. He finds the neighbor gravely ill, and ignores his wife's pleas to come home and care for his own daughter, who has taken a turn for the worse.","95":"The Count sets out to make a private room for him and his Countess, built in such a way no one can see, hear, and most importantly, disturb them. But unbeknownst to the Count, his wife has set her eyes on the court minstrel. Based on Edgar Allan Poe's \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's \u201cLa Grande Breteche\u201d.","96":"On a whim, a greedy tycoon decides to corner the world market in wheat. This doubles the price of bread, forcing grain producers into charity lines and others further into poverty. The film contrasts the differences between the lives of those who work to grow the wheat and the life of the man who dabbles in its sale for profit.","97":"A man leaves his wife and two daughters for work in a carpentry shop. At work, he initially refuses a beer with lunch, then gives in. After work, two friends take a little while to convince him to go for a refreshing malt beverage, then to have another and another....","98":"Farmer Al Falfa goes to New York, money bag in hand. He is immediately spotted by a crook who dispatches a fetching lady to shake him down. At a restaurant, she gets him drunk and lays him out with knockout drops. But what's in the bag is not what she is expecting, and she flees. The now-drunken farmer has stepped dizzily outside to acquaint himself with a lamppost when another sharper steps up and hauls him into a crooked card game.
