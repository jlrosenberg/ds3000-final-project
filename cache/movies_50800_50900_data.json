ranger Donald sends his bears off to hibernate, but Humphrey would rather stay in his hammock, run out for a glass of water, etc., than sleep; when he does get to sleep, his snoring gets him thrown out. His search for a new bed leads him right into the ranger's house.","1":"Beekeeper Donald catches Humphrey the bear raiding his hives. He complains to Ranger Woodlore, who assembles his bears and lectures them. Donald puts up a barbed wire fence, which slows Humphrey down a bit, but doesn't stop him.","2":"Humphrey the bear isn't having much luck with his fishing; every time he catches some nice fish, he gets distracted and drops them. So he goes after the catches of the local anglers instead. But ranger Woodlore frowns on this, insisting the bear fish like one.","3":"The city of Anyburg decides its traffic situation has gotten out of hand, so it puts the automobile on trial. The trial (conducted in rhyme) starts with a car that was in a hit-and-run accident, followed by a sports car whose sins are peeling rubber and general hot-rodding, followed by a heap, on trial for lack of safety. Next, a number of safety equipment designers testify that, despite their best efforts, the accident rate keeps rising. Through all this, the defense lawyer declines to ask questions. A highway designer bemoans the problems on his beautiful roads. At last, defense. He shows a number of scenarios, pointing out that the real problem isn't the car but the driver. Everyone left the courtroom, declaring the car not guilty, and drove politely again, for a little while.","4":"J.J. Fate again shows us how accidents aren't his fault, but instead are the result of carelessness. Donald is Mr. Careful at home, but at work, he starts right off by falling down the stairs. He has run-ins with a punch press, flammable paint, a conveyor belt, loose clothing, a monkey wrench, and other problems.","5":"Two stylized nursery rhymes are shown. First is \"The House That Jack Built\" as told with a variety of characters composed of letters that spell out their names (Example: the cow is made up of an intertwined C, O, and W). Next is \"Old MacDonald Had a Band\" (no, not farm) in which Old MacDonald and his band give way with a hot jazz number (even his animals play instruments). The piece comes to an end when Old MacDonald's wife is tired of doing all the housework and gives him a swift whack on his head with her rolling pin.","6":"The lion is trapped by the safari and brought to New York, where he's accidentally set free, but nobody is intimidated by him.","7":"It's a peaceful day in a local city when suddenly, duck J.J. Fate appears to lecture us on how \"fate\" isn't to blame for accidents, people are! He uses Donald Duck as an example. Donald is extremely accident prone. He lights his pipe in a room with a gas leak, slips on a throw rug while carrying a fish bowl, overloads electrical outlets, and continually falls down the stairs. Finally, Donald has had enough and fixes his house guaranteeing no more accidents. That's good for Donald but the rest of the accident prone city still has to learn \"not to blame fate for your carelessness\".","8":"Jiminy Cricket explains the relatively recent rise of leisure time, and explains how to enjoy it safely: the proper places to play, and basic safety rules for hiking, swimming, bicycling, ice skating, sun-bathing, etc.","9":"Jiminy Cricket explains the sense of touch, its four components (heat, cold, pain, pressure), and its unique dispersed nature.","10":"Jiminy Cricket explains how every living thing has its proper kind of food, and how it is used, plus the basics of nutrition.","11":"Jiminy Cricket explains how man resembles and differs from other animals, particularly the use of language, the use of reason, and opposable thumbs.","12":"Jiminy Cricket narrates the history and practice of bicycle safety.","13":"Jiminy Cricket explains the basics of fire safety.","14":"Jiminy Cricket explains the interconnected senses of smell and taste.","15":"At the race track, various spectators (all Goofy lookalikes) are playing the ponies. A posh rich Goofy bets on the equally posh Snapshot III while another more common looking Goofy bets on the bedraggled Old Moe. When the race begins, Snapshot and the rider are so overconfident they wait a few minutes after the race has begun to start running. When they finally do get going, Snapshot is not above stooping to dirty tricks such as tripping and biting the other horses. Sadly, Snapshot's vanity is what costs him winning the race (he stops to pose for the photo finish) and Old Moe is declared the winner.","16":"Donald is shoveling the snow off his walk; Chip 'n' Dale are shoveling their branch. Donald tricks them into shoveling his walk. Angered, they sneak into his house, where he's getting ready to make popcorn. They've never seen this before, but they love it. They stow away in the box, then make off with the bowl of popped corn.","17":"Donald is trying to sell brushes door-to-door, but since nobody can understand him, nobody will buy anything. He happens across a street vendor selling voice pills. They work great, but he's only got a limited number so of course, the last pill ends up in various inconvenient places.","18":"Donald moves into a new home, and discovers his new neighbor is a slob, a mooch, and has a dog that comes crashing through the fence and digging in Donald's garden. Eventually it escalates into a full-scale war, with crowds cheering and TV coverage.","19":"It's the 1890's, and Donald is riding his penny-farthing bicycle to see Daisy when Chip 'n Dale make fun of him. It quickly escalates into a full-fledged war between Donald and the chipmunks.","20":"While traveling with his nephews, Donald is disgusted that they are only interested in comics. He stops at the \"fountain of youth\" and tricks the kids into thinking he is a baby again. However, he gets tangled up with an aggressive mother alligator and her babies, and makes a hurried exit with the nephews.","21":"Chip 'n Dale live next door to a zoo and spot the elephant's stash of peanuts. They go after them, but both the elephant and his keeper, Donald, are too clever. Then the boys realized the visitors throw peanuts, so they put on a song-and-dance act. Then they paint themselves white and pose as albino chipmunks.","22":"Come along with Donald Duck as he visits one of nature's masterpieces. After a little ragtime rain dance, Donald strikes up a conversation with himself at Echo Cliff, then teeters along the edge of a precarious trail while riding a sure-footed burrow. It's a tough job for park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore to keep Donald in check, but it gets even tougher when they run afoul of a napping mountain lion.","23":"Mrs. Goofy leaves for the day leaving the house in the hands of her husband, Goofy. Goofy is confident that he can handle the day's household chores but he keeps making typical goof-ups while attempting them. His first mistake is sending Junior to school on a Saturday. At first, he just makes small blunders but, of course, they keep escalating to the point where his house is flooded, scribbled on, set on fire, invaded by firemen and policemen alike, and, basically, an utter disaster area when the wife returns.","24":"In the city, Goofy finds his daily job much too stressful so he decides to leave this hustle and bustle for a more peaceful life in the tropics. He finds life there most enjoyable collecting shells from the beach, making a hut in which to live, getting back to nature, and even joining in the big luau feast (with meals such as shark fin soup).

Finally, Donald decides to marry Daisy but when waiting for her to arrive so he can pop the question, he falls asleep and has a nightmarish vision of what married life would be like (among other things that he'll be forced to do all the housework and be served a burnt T bone for dinner). Needless to say, the marriage is called off when he awakens.","32":"'Mac' Bootle Beetle tells, referring to the ship's log, how he and captain Donald Duck were sole survivors of a shipwreck. The insect always suspected the duck wasn't quite fair, actually he was constantly cheated out of his rations share and used as angling bait without realizing it, both on the wreckage raft and after they drifted onto a deserted island, but ultimately they were rescued and stayed together for life, although even at their ripe age Donald.","33":"After several long days at work, Goofy finally takes a much needed vacation.

Luckily, the two semi-intelligible chipmunks happen to see the half-unintelligible Donald Duck, a park ranger, planting acorns. They immediately set to steal his bag of the precious nuts. Donald soon realizes what they are up to, and sets out a box propped up with a stick. It's a crude trap, with an acorn as bait; but it's not too crude to fool Dale, who upsets it and traps Chip. Soon, Donald finds he can have fun instigating a fight between these two quarrelsome chipmunks, but he underestimates their friendship and their ability to work as a team against a common enemy: in this case, a bad-tempered duck.","36":"It's a peaceful day in a national forest...until hunting season begins at which point all the bears hide out in a cave but one bear, Humphrey, doesn't make it. He hides out in a cabin and, seeing hunter Donald Duck approaching, hides the bearskin rug in a trunk and takes its place.

Finally, when hunting season ends and Donald leaves, Humphrey is relieved but makes a startling discovery.","37":"Donald cheerfully sets up his umbrella etcetera for a day at the beach, but so did a mischievously lazy bee, who doesn't accept his actions inadvertently mess up the bee's spot.

Unfortunately a melomanic apis melifera (Latin for honeybee) is as avid to listen on the same radio to a mellifluous symphony and play the director theatrically, waving a match as baton, instead of fertilizing his garden flowers. Donald first just turns the switch, then hides it, but the bee dials inside, so he tries to chase it, but is scared by the sting. The battle for channel choice gets worse, and vindictive.","43":"Goofy is tired and bored. He needs a hobby and decides to pursue photography.

As they drive off, Donald plots his revenge and executes it, when the boys return in Donald's new car.","46":"Two coyotes (father and son) smell food. They arrive in a campsite just in time to see the owner (presumably Mickey) heading downriver in a boat. The food is secured up in a tree, and Pluto, though sleeping, is standing guard.

Pluto realizes that, without the coyotes, he's going to get blamed, and goes off to join his former foes","47":"Minnie Mouse knits a sweater for Pluto.

But Mickey has planned ahead.","52":"An old beetle (though he looks more like Jiminy Cricket) living next door to Donald Duck explains to his young charge why Donald's garden isn't the paradise it appears to be, by recounting his battles with Donald when he first discovered the garden, and his narrow escape assisted by a couple of birds.","53":"Goofey is portrayed as George Geef, a typical common man who makes a perfect prey for all kinds of swindlers, bookmakers and the like, eager to be a 'good looser' after they 'won' all his money; never mind the name of the game nor the venue, from alley to casino and 'friendly' poker nights. Alas, even when lady luck smiles at him, the poor player doesn't stand a chance against the worst gold-digger of all: the wife, who 'manually' blames his irresponsible behavior when he looses but otherwise cheerfully claims all his occasional hard-earned winnings for her own fashionable waste.","54":"Pluto falls for Dinah the dachshund; so does Butch.

Desperate for spending money, he gets it in the last place he knows: his three nephews' piggy bank.
