Rich plays Larry, a troubled teen living in the rough Red Hook section of Brooklyn who decides he wants out and turns to crime to fund his escape. But his plan involves scamming the neighborhood's biggest drug kingpin, a heist that's dangerous at best.","92":"When a spoiled English girl living in 19th century India loses both parents in a cholera epidemic, she is sent back to England to live in a country mansion. The lord is a strange old man-- frail and deformed, immensely kind but so melancholy. She wishes to discover what has caused him so much sorrow and to bring joy back to the household. It all must have something to do with the screams and wails which echo through the house at night and no one wants to talk about.","93":"Carrie Gemmell, an office woman that initially appears to lead a dull life working at an uninspiring office job. At night, however, she has several surreal fantasies involving sex, blood, and a young woman (Cheryl Singleton) she works with at the office. \"She\" will occasionally wake up in strange places and is convinced that she's turning into a werewolf - something that she believes is evidenced by her teeth elongating.","94":"A Soviet cult cartoon, so untypical for a Western viewer, especially, a little one. A boy named Malysh (\"A Little One\") suffers from solitude being the youngest of the three children in a Swedish family. The acute sense of solitude makes him desperately want a dog, but before he gets one, he \"invents\" a friend - the very Karlson who lives upon the roof. So typical for the Russian culture spirit of mischief, which is, actually, never punished, and the notion that relative welfare not necessarily means happiness made the book by Astrid Lindgren and its TV adaptations tremendously popular in the Soviet Union and nowadays Russia and vice versa - somewhat alienated to the Western reader and viewer (see User's comments below). However, both the book and the cartoon are truly universal - entertaining and funny for the children and thought-provoking and somewhat sad for grownups.","95":"A drunk uncle attempts to score with his flirtatious step-niece on Christmas Eve.","96":"Faro is about a man who flees into the forest with his daughter to escape a prison sentence.","97":"At Big Jim\u2019s Auto Depot there\u2019s only one rule. The last man \u2013 or woman \u2013 standing wins. Eight teens enter, one teen leaves. Actually, all eight teens leave, but only one leaves with the ride of their dreams. To reach that dream, they\u2019re going through a nightmare. Keep your hand on the car. That sounds simple enough, but two days of sleep deprivation and fierce competition can make things awfully hard.","98":"Eve Hallows' 18th birthday comes with an unexpected family legacy of magic. When Eve attempts a spell to speak with her deceased mother, she accidentally summons a vengeful witch who threatens to wreak havoc. As a Halloween party goes wrong and a theater becomes the stage for disaster, it is up to Eve to believe in herself and take control of her destiny.","99":"When her birthday wish magically summons wacky Hollywood actor Drake to her small Midwestern town, Sophie has to figure out how to help him fit in until she can get him back home. But Drake is more interested in helping Sophie stand out."},"popularity":{"0":null,"1":3.048,"2":4.445,"3":4.307,"4":3.653,"5":7.834,"6":1.527,"7":40.106,"8":8.358,"9":3.164,"10":2.589,"11":13.567,"12":1.069,"13":6.945,"14":2.404,"15":2.031,"16":8.248,"17":8.175,"18":null,"19":9.143,"20":3.636,"21":10.442,"22":1.77,"23":3.156,"24":1.415,"25":1.88,"26":2.33,"27":1.575,"28":4.767,"29":3.134,"30":2.028,"31":1.521,"32":0.68,"33":1.057,"34":9.645,"35":1.886,"36":1.061,"37":5.663,"38":5.984,"39":8.017,"40":3.583,"41":10.926,"42":6.345,"43":8.45,"44":1.087,"45":0.999,"46":0.694,"47":2.126,"48":5.171,"49":1.539,"50":3.879,"51":23.121,"52":4.53,"53":2.714,"54":1.004,"55":2.684,"56":3.782,"57":0.988,"58":1.201,"59":2.003,"60":1.862,"61":2.486,"62":2.538,"63":4.435,"64":0.888,"65":7.694,"66":4.292,"67":5.147,"68":6.655,"69":1.293,"70":0.6,"71":2.965,"72":2.501,"73":12.452,"74":9.433,"75":0.853,"76":4.275,"77":17.396,"78":1.815,"79":0.883,"80":1.943,"81":1.103,"82":1.454,"83":3.427,"84":7.274,"85":1.935,"86":7.752,"87":9.25,"88":1.704,"89":1.85,"90":null,"91":1.168,"92":5.24,"93":1.73,"94":4.116,"95":6.57,"96":1.481,"97":7.511,"98":4.917,"99":3.324},"poster_path":{"0":null,"1":"\/aiS2gDecKnJOEUcYnLCRm01EF9B.jpg","2":"\/tS0y6sEvzgOwGYpwaNn9mOVrLxG.jpg","3":"\/zAN0PkWfOueVSc1QlGSY7OPQMOt.jpg","4":"\/vzZ2VBCm2C1j1pWNeHCUVPfsYo4.jpg","5":"\/dWFyOj0wk8AFLqC8PH5LRD3kJht.jpg","6":"\/4s6aUGjsjP3FkiC98HzWmXvA0FR.jpg","7":"\/4jfwP5Nc6WB5G7HvCnv3GQGzsH2.jpg","8":"\/cDIM1XSv4a4UpNUU7xe7w4nAMTQ.jpg","9":"\/ygmrU2F2JwUtjpn6EBOrRq0pKCD.jpg","10":"\/lE2Hb5jAUNuHffiessdBR9nVN30.jpg","11":"\/hPoSSqDqkKSIP2l3t6pyre9u5Ze.jpg","12":"\/eztk17d9gzXBoq7vkpfClpCuYW.jpg","13":"\/A9wTBWnx6nKitul3vjKHrRKjWRk.jpg","14":"\/g8pSYEkUOAIEYfz3veyMVOSmeSg.jpg","15":"\/tQUWVpmV0XZueMLdEdNuOfLJylX.jpg","16":"\/6TbmALbiJNDsEGAmse0Yzp4PDjF.jpg","17":"\/2j5ZhYMPf45JYFswlkFhw9dLYd1.jpg","18":null,"19":"\/wA6qvKKHbJjON5V4VMhi5kDKQmG.jpg","20":"\/gnH2ONPcIkdXVsl2fkXaFVRvPjL.jpg","21":"\/7VbkNmlc54mmkAQ63CByqy0W9Eo.jpg","22":"\/uhgmmCF1VsihjrCizQwKvFHU8j2.jpg","23":"\/h0tqXVeZLCVbTl5hibXuCOlzd71.jpg","24":"\/tzja37bUiNRtdhmq5ERjTVdJuRa.jpg","25":"\/3IfjizLBHlsWtpLEEET1Q0QFC5O.jpg","26":"\/5uqz8MbGts35uO7ESz86kviVgFO.jpg","27":"\/1hZzP8SdTQeu7R6AYUxfuEPrYRI.jpg","28":"\/iX7U4xLLLPk1PsCpBTWuW71rZO7.jpg","29":"\/tzPBiT8uQhpqUtVoaEkM9TpkHjO.jpg","30":"\/j7SrASTfBBhui9LscWE36ryqsfQ.jpg","31":"\/6RG2e5r8KlviPBvEPTCrG4ExFQK.jpg","32":"\/6rCc2vA4BT8iQ2FutYV0Xgg5Nhd.jpg","33":"\/52fikxyPsCqZTMN7S5qTpcK4lzc.jpg","34":"\/47qB83tIFr9CuX6RHsTapk0W3Ls.jpg","35":"\/ePQt6sXTlv0awy0CnFDZ1wfBJqd.jpg","36":"\/c5p4nTRr03ol2Rblbbi1zlJiDrs.jpg","37":"\/4VGkBgXoJ8ixcG4ZHMBdId14CNX.jpg","38":"\/hsXFJyNHzbR53NeVjpnHJb3EOUR.jpg","39":"\/7I7AxQAlvufEg2aWFd2HbS4f47B.jpg","40":"\/jdfQpgECLfmN3Ibg1Cves1xUUlO.jpg","41":"\/hnXsIGagaml2srU3E54DE2lJveF.jpg","42":"\/5TDZqiRPBhUNDRermZ5HfKf4WoF.jpg","43":"\/1FWxESqVtnc4N1274x0uVSph3S4.jpg","44":null,"45":null,"46":"\/d7YloejVvMZpCUB6PtumeMzTnrP.jpg","47":"\/8FHwd8k973d0Pgekw8EJ1FvvzSh.jpg","48":"\/r6Z9GcVtbmU7CRmigKTiI6wg4Jg.jpg","49":"\/nuuAsi26qQEnvO6QOTQgyTVbaxP.jpg","50":"\/hLOO5qg4l1Xlh2J61X3azzBRJSZ.jpg","51":"\/cGLwfmLqg39822RFQMUDat0UJev.jpg","52":"\/hpgDqHb72lv0ldw4JzkwbnTd4eW.jpg","53":"\/1q1jra0erUyw68A9lsyopMpUU1u.jpg","54":"\/fnvAzCiJomNvzgLEnxd1cYZIFxj.jpg","55":"\/9rSJaSUEQbiMEcr9zNWo0SQPUEK.jpg","56":"\/vpuDlbSSSP3CG4GSvE7PlEak2n9.jpg","57":"\/xHRjAwqH0QBuHUuBcZywfValVms.jpg","58":"\/f3LOnWCGihKfsIS0mutadazGowi.jpg","59":"\/9hKw5mBCeg7zbADw67b1BElopr.jpg","60":"\/mtTMX1Jkhz0QG3w0bry3V8PfIHk.jpg","61":"\/f8XHw3q3Eek2HaT8G5QkAY7isg7.jpg","62":"\/7r4ZsO94xsywEJ3ZH8JHjDhj8EG.jpg","63":"\/h6SF7r9z7hbWTJW1GM0VRUIvwUn.jpg","64":null,"65":"\/vy6utl2sicj6imeVxeplzI9AYWn.jpg","66":"\/dBgEdBeMg4KDJaWGRUmPKppQg2I.jpg","67":"\/6a1Df6LLH2YLNuCY0EOzpTaYYf0.jpg","68":"\/e2UlmNAx6qiRe9cS3bcaX25839c.jpg","69":"\/laDb8OKptERLtn3CXz4NGFW0oQR.jpg","70":"\/wli0d5eObpZ8fKQSlZo1Gy6IgjI.jpg","71":"\/n46Eu1svHme12m1NqROiQFmSZCv.jpg","72":"\/4QqBlJ0qctkV6yNtp4wiKZFJtAY.jpg","73":"\/bpTNGIJkdYL8IJvvCmKmjtDpXn1.jpg","74":"\/u8OWkOvW6p31QsmQ4j32ZphPL24.jpg","75":"\/2E9d1Usule98ofykymjGx8MUW2x.jpg","76":"\/a5p020pc0ZFE71ia8KV2KDvacAr.jpg","77":"\/xyhoW9qK7ZaDM1V4A6pPL9DWjn8.jpg","78":"\/hqNUtA59gWTgwzAhNmpZmIqQGRd.jpg","79":"\/rd2h8efnjfVyDuPmh1eIUcJcKaT.jpg","80":"\/iyG6N34J8LMf0VKCAaR3TUpythZ.jpg","81":"\/beNrijPQaLdDTSTvV233ijzRuVY.jpg","82":"\/1G1YIkSgUz2JygqN9urzbPfOHLJ.jpg","83":"\/qMo23cLFvbxIGnLDXTu1OezGa6w.jpg","84":"\/vidfsb8UxcWIl0amKk7adYdKWVh.jpg","85":"\/mxQlHDQiYH6jyJ1nA6au41JsRep.jpg","86":"\/aB1zGc5BNHSaQlEhOSni4ts8DrL.jpg","87":"\/ic73CrivkWEYMENwWALxgryf21f.jpg","88":"\/cAN6gajQSTbX1LZxsG1DAczDCCe.jpg","89":"\/hDh7s3d8GCCVS9v6X59FafWTNom.jpg","90":null,"91":"\/pGk0Mowa0NLqRklF71RIFtXs7qE.jpg","92":"\/4WgnGGYHpbMCiCGyqPMwQOirGee.jpg","93":"\/fpW7guCH72znIQZ689JWpF1gMrE.jpg","94":"\/H4WHAm4yHcTUMvPgupZ5OcV4nc.jpg","95":"\/7cCOVw563woaCw0fUmC7mRGchmx.jpg","96":"\/yneV2DZhgFmVnGcGtSGD8GZFlnA.jpg","97":"\/5FxwA8I8WJgx1eSfQiSR2ZDdRIA.jpg","98":"\/eU9IBodwp3RnTgIJzwKjHow1LI3.jpg","99":"\/uwyvClqccWsilx
