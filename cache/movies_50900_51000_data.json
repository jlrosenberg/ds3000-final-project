The jack breaks, the radiator explodes, then the remaining three tires go flat. Donald gives up in disgust and drives on with the flats. The film features references to the rubber shortage during World War II.","1":"Mickey courts Minnie in the Gay Nineties: they take in a vaudeville show and go for a drive in his horseless carriage, to the strains of \"While Strolling Through the Park\" and \"In the Good Old Summertime\". Goofy rides by on a penny-farthing bicycle, and the whole Duck family rides by on a bicycle built for five.","2":"Donald tries his best to be polite and dignified as a hotel bellboy. But when his first guest is Pete Junior, the job is next to impossible.","3":"Donald is digging in his gold mine, mostly generic looking dark rocks, and being clumsy, to the great amusement of his burro, when he accidentally fills his cart with a load of pure gold. The burro takes off and dumps the cart, Donald and all, into a scary looking crusher. Donald barely makes it through the machinery.","4":"Donald has to get up early, but everything seems to be working to keep him awake. His loudly ticking alarm clock resists several attempts to quiet it. Donald ultimately swallows it; the glow-in-the-dark dial can be seen through his feathers. Then his folding bed folds up on him. Springs start popping out of it; Donald builds an elaborate framework to hold it down. Finally, enough of the clock reassembles itself to sound the alarm and night is over.","5":"Figaro the cat wants to eat Cleo the goldfish in this Pinocchio short.","6":"Donald Duck is ordered to wipe out a Japanese airfield. After parachuting out of an airplane, he lands in a Japanese forest. He uses an inflated canoe to cross the river, but as soon as it fills up with water, Donald is running for his life. He makes sure the canoe hits nothing that would pop it. When he gets to the edge of a cliff, he sees the airfield. The canoe has already exploded, causing water to flow. This large amount of water splashes onto the airfield, wiping the whole thing clean, but leaving disfigured airplanes","7":"Mickey guest-directs a radio orchestra. The sponsor loves the rehearsal, but come the actual performance, Goofy drops all the instruments under an elevator, so they sound like toys. The sponsor hates it, but the audience loves it anyway.","8":"Mickey's going golfing, and Pluto is his caddy. Besides the usual caddy duties, Pluto runs to the ball and points to it. But when the ball lands in a gopher hole, Pluto's got another task: chase the gopher. They eventually chase each other through a number of holes in a knoll where Mickey is trying to putt out, causing the knoll to collapse.","9":"Ajax the killer gorilla has escaped from the zoo. Donald's nephews dress up as a gorilla, but soon Donald encounters the real gorilla, and they chase each other until the radio broadcasts instructions for subduing Ajax.","10":"A narrator tells the story of how the Western pioneers (all being Goofy lookalikes) are travelling in covered wagons across the frontier. They run into some Indians (who are also Goofy lookalikes) and battle breaks out between them. Suddenly a tornado comes by and sweeps up the covered wagons, dropping them into various states such as \"Wash\", \"Organ\", and \"Californy.\"","11":"An older beetle of a rare variety advises a young passerby against crossing a stream, where he is likely to get trapped by bug collector Donald, as he himself almost was when he was young.","12":"Pluto is patrolling a beach for the Coast Guard when a baby turtle hatches. The turtle keeps trying to sneak into the restricted zone to swim, and Pluto keeps trying to stop him. But when Pluto stumbles into some quicksand, he suddenly needs help from his foe.","13":"Police dog Pluto is tracking down Butch, the dog that abducted rich dog \"Ronnie\" for a 10,000 bone ransom. Pluto releases Ronnie, but is hunted by Butch.","14":"Pluto's kid brother, K.B., keeps getting into trouble. When Butch the bulldog passes by, K.B. latches onto him. Butch gets K.B. to crawl into a meat market through a small slot. Pluto comes along, they tussle and set off the burglar alarm, which brings the dogcatcher, who grabs Butch.","15":"Donald is preparing a little picnic when he sees some ants passing by. He decides to tease one, ultimately by piling lots of food onto it. The ant eventually stumbles, but realizes Donald is sitting on a veritable gold mine. He rallies his fellow ants, and while Donald is napping, they cart him to a cliff and drop him into the river. When he returns to the raid in progress, he finds himself powerless to stop it. He dynamites the ant hill, but that only separates the ledge he's standing on, and he finds himself in the river again as the ants finish off a cupcake.","16":"For some reason, Donald adopts a baby. It turns out not to be a duck, but a kangaroo. Donald takes little Joey home and tries to make him take a bath, with the help of the friendly lady of the adoption bureau on the telephone telling him what to do. After the bath, Donald's baby is scared by the rug made of a bear.","17":"Donald is travelling the countryside and decides to rest for the night. He refuses to stay at the motel because of its $16 fee so he sets up camp in a woodland area.
