Set to classical music by the likes of Bach, Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and Shoshtakovich, and replete with rapidly mutating geometries, Bute\u2019s filmmaking is at once formally rigorous and energetically high-spirited, like a marriage of high modernism and Merrie Melodies. In the late 1940s, Lewis Jacobs observed that Bute\u2019s films were \u201ccomposed upon mathematical formulae depicting in ever-changing lights and shadows, growing lines and forms, deepening colors and tones, the tumbling, racing impressions evoked by the musical accompaniment.\u201d Bute herself wrote that she sought to \u201cbring to the eyes a combination of visual forms unfolding along with the thematic development and rhythmic cadences of music.\u201d","34":"A perfect fusion of poetry and film, with dense layered imagery and music from electro pioneers Louise and Bebe Barron.

To realize this aim I have put into motion, one by one, pieces of this sculpture and, with color lighting, filmed them in various detail, overlaying the images on the film as they appear and disappear.

In contrast to the high end 2K digital technology used to restore \u2018Manhatta\u2019 and 'Ballet Mechanique', I learned filmmaking decades earlier on a 35mm Oxberry beam-splitter, multi-head, aerial-image bi-pac optical printer. A dinosaur by today\u2019s standards and all hand operated prior to the advent of computer-assists, this machine was precise and exact to the frame. \u2019S&J: Pt. 3' took 26 hours to shoot straight thru without one mistake.\u201d  \u2014Bruce Posner","45":"1941 was Francis Lee's first film; CH'AN his last.
