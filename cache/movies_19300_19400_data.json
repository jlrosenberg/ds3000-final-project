In an historic migration after World War II, Hasidism found it's most vital center in America.

When it comes to looks and body image, gay men can be a pretty tough crowd. Men are visually programmed. And gay men have an appreciation for beauty in all aspects, whether it's other male bodies or just antiques. There's no doubt that attractiveness is key to a man's self-esteem and his impression on others, especially in gay life. The pressure to look good is even more intense in an image- driven culture where near-naked images of masculine perfection abound. Men are being objectified as never before. From super models and muscle boys, to bears and twinks to average Joes, along with experts in the business of beauty, \"The Adonis Factor\" is a revealing look at gay men's love or lust for all things pretty.","8":"In Uganda, a new bill threatens to make homosexuality punishable by death.

The camera agilely penetrates everyday life. Though opposed to censorship, Fuck Off! itself transgresses the boundaries of privacy.","21":"A French special op suffers an existential crisis as he wanders New York City in search of a mission and the requisite connections.","22":"Fuke visits his uncle Idriz and aunt Sabira to fix a broken boiler.
