Showing our lives as consumers, under the thumbs of privileged individuals and their methods of control. But the world is awakening, and the experience is something outside the normal rules of social interaction, causing excitement in those who are not served by the current system... and fear in those who are pampered by it.

There are several action sequences involving chases and shootouts, but since there's no clear narrative we're not sure how they relate to each other or to anything else.
