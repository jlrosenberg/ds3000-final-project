When Jerry gets out of Tom's ineffective prison, he discovers this and takes full advantage of it though he's rather confused, since Tom and George look alike. When Tom and George find this out, it's their turn to have some fun.","46":"Harold is a seemingly peaceful neighbor in a quiet mid-western neighborhood, but underneath, he's a murderous psychopath who sets his eyes on a couple that have moved in across the street.","47":"This hand-painted and elaborately step-printed work begins with a flourish of reds and yellows and purples in palpable fruit-like shapes interspersed by darkness, then becomes lit lightning-like by sharp multiply-colored twigs-of shape, all resolving into shapes of decay.","48":"Two curious teenage boys break into an old mortuary looking for thrills, only to find themselves stalked by a former teacher who is a very real vampire looking to increase the ranks of the undead.","49":"Multiple thrusts and then retractions of oranges, reds, blues, and the flickering, almost black, textural dissolves suggesting an amalgam approaching script.","50":"Dark, fast-paced symmetry in mixed weave of tones moving from oranges & yellows to blue-greens, then retreating (dissolves of zooming away) to both rounded and soft-edged shapes shot with black.","51":"Elaborate petal-like and multicolored flowers rising in white space until the whole field is as if crushed by floral designs in madly-swift mixtures of every conceivable previous shape from the Persian Series.","52":"Dark blood red slow shifting tones (often embedded in dark) \/ (often shot-thru with parallel wave-like lines) composed of all previous shapes and flowers as if trying, linearly, to evolve a glyph-script.","53":"Persian Series #6 begins with what appears to be dried red and yellow rose petals, suddenly shot-thru with blue which causes a shift to violets and greens. This mash of colors thickens and is scored by white and then black, calligraphic lines, which are \"echoed\" in all previous floral colors whose \"dance\" seems to turn clock-wise and \"explode\" into fiery reds.","54":"Very pale, thin, hieroglyphic pinks, greens and blues in a white space which is thickened over by ribbed mashes of these colors which \"dissolve\" into varied shapes almost suggesting landscapes and ephemeral bouquets. Dark blurred shapes mix with each other and give-way to clockwise-turning pillars of yellow, scored with white glyphs, at times, and fading mashes of tones and, finally, a calligraphic shape.","55":"Pale petal and stem-like shapes counter punted rhythmically by an even paler \"background\" of truly ephemeral of truly ephemeral (almost invisible) shapes. Again, the foreground movement is clockwise and often \"ribbed\" as the film darkens into a blend of foreground\/background and, eventually, a meld as of white hardened clots fretted by glyphs.","56":"Sharp edged \"chunks\" of color set in black, straight, often multicolored, lines piercing shapes, imprisoning them, until they are fragmented bits of color in black: repeat of this theme again and again until darkness prevails, but is then broken open by pure white shards and \"spears\" restoring the original \"dance\" of hard-edge shapes and lines, which then begin to whirl clockwise, interspersed with fade-outs, and then shatter into \"confetti\" texture, in black, burnt \"sugar-shapes\" and the overwhelming flare of yellow.","57":"\"Twigs\" of color in space, and pure white \"ghosts\" of them in the background interspersed with dark amalgams of these and conglomerate forms. The resolve of these themes is a combination of \"amalgams\" and \"ghosts\" at one in interplay, and then dark slashed spaces with \"webs\" of white, webbed spaces on white and, finally, solarization of colored forms - midst which the frame-line rises from bottom and drifts a few seconds visible, creating an insubstantiality of the frame of these images.","58":"Persian Series #11 begins with a \"window\" of yellow paint adrift in the full frame of multicolored paint-shapes. Alternating black-space\/white-space exists as a back-drop for slashes and curves of color - reds and blues shifting to red-blue-green, then yellow, etc. slashed in black.","59":"\"Hot\" by-play of reds-greens-yellows in black, blurred, finally, as the color shapes are shifted violently from side to side, finally ending of a sharp entanglement of multicolored twig-like and\/or stem-like forms.","60":"Persian Series #13 is a series of extremely dark images, mostly in purples, greens, and fiery red-orange-yellows, shifting one to another in displays of textured shapes which suggest a thick tangle weave of threads.","61":"Persian Series #14 is composed of muted color-shapes shifting variably in juxtaposition and contrast with high-contrast black & white abstract patterns.","62":"Persian Series #15 is a rapid shift of patterns black & white playing off against muted coils of color.","63":"Persian Series #16 is an even more exaggerated contrast of color and black-and-white patterning.","64":"Persian Series #17 is a series of quite distinct globules of paint brilliantly colored and shifting as if vertically in the plane (as different from the more horizontally oriented previous parts).","65":"Persian Series #18 is almost calligraphic in its overlays of dark (occasionally colored) glyphs backed by brilliant color motifs.","66":"The Men in Black have always protected the Earth from the scum of the universe. In this new adventure, they tackle their biggest, most global threat to date: a mole in the Men in Black organization.","67":"Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called \"Forky\" to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy.","68":"Dr Gerald Bull was a genius at designing and building superguns (very large long range guns capable of shooting  at ranges more than 100 miles). When an operational plan by the CIA to export sanctioned arms to apartheid-South Africa through him was exposed, the CIA denied all knowledge and he went to jail. He was later released, and moved to Belgium to start a subsidiary, of which a major project was to help Saddam Hussein build a new supergun capable of firing over 500 miles.","69":"What if a child from another world crash-landed on Earth, but instead of becoming a hero to mankind, he proved to be something far more sinister?","70":"Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all Mexico, runs to the rescue of his two drunken rodent friends, Pablo and Fernando, who keep wandering into the hungry clutches of an alley cat.","71":"This short, otherwise unremarkable feature is of some interest because of the way that it unabashedly caters to the tastes that it perceived in its audiences. Besides combining the elements of the risqu\u00e9 'blue' movies of the era with the popularity of movies about fires, it also attempted to use the combination to get extra mileage out of it.  The movie's title summarises the setup, and most of the footage shows firefighters using ladders to rescue stage girls, clad in portions of their costumes, from an upper level. Although it all seems pretty tame by today's standards, it no doubt provided its male viewers with some brief moments of excitement as the various women hurried down the ladders with their costumes in disarray.
