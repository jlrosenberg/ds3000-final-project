Eschewing dialogue, the director constructs a non-narrative story in fragments that reveal the daily lives of an adulterous couple interspersed with a cryptic stream of unrelated imagery.

The general attitude about the mullet is not all positive; some people are even harassed for having one. The director toured the USA asking one and all what they thought about this coif. The journey is not only hilariously funny, it's also enlightening. Turns out, the mullet isn't just a dyke cut.

From a couple fighting the odds of fertility to young teenagers losing their virginity, the film follows nine very different couples on the night they conceive, showing that sex can sometimes be more neurotic than erotic. The hilarious ensemble cast includes Emmy-winner Julie Bowen and Sarah Hyland (\u201cModern Family\u201d), Connie Britton (\u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d), David Arquette (Never Been Kissed), Jason Mantzoukas (\u201cThe League\u201d), and Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball).","29":"The moon is such a familiar presence in the sky that most of us take it for granted.

The result, complete with a chorus of gentlemen of Japan as cartoon-like British peers, emphatically underscores the Englishness of the satire. The occasional non sequiturs, like a bunch of gentry dressed for Ascot and singing in Japanese, are loonily fun, and no more absurd than the fantasyland Japan that Gilbert and Sullivan invented. The time frame, though, seems little more than an excuse for a smart black-and-white production design.","35":"In 1977 France, the Ministry of the Future chooses two \u201cnormal,\u201d white, middle-class citizens, Claudine and Jean-Michel, for a national experiment.
